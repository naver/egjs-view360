A lot of things changed as the major version went up to v4.

In this guide, we will guide you through the changes so that those who used the previous major version can move on to v4.

## SpinViewer (deprecated)
:::danger
SpinViewer is no longer available from v4. View360 now offers only PanoViewer.
:::
- PanoViewer renamed to View360.
- If you're using SpinViewer, you can still use v3.

## HTML structure
Traditionally, View360 required only one container element.
A canvas was added inside the container and the style was force-injected.
This method has the advantage of being a little more convenient, but it has the disadvantage of being difficult to predict the style after the PanoViewer is mounted.

In the new version, both the container element and the canvas element must be given to mount View360.
In addition, we're providing a separate CSS file without directly injecting the default style.
This makes it easy to predict the size of the displayed area even if View360 is not mounted, and makes it easy to adjust the viewer ratio through helper classes.

> v3

```html
<div class="viewer" id="myPanoViewer"></div>
```

> v4

```html
<head>
  <!-- CSS file is now provided. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://naver.github.io/egjs-view360/release/latest/css/view360.min.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- You need to add a class view360-container. -->
  <!-- In addition, you can easily change the viewer's ratio through a ratio helper class (such as is-16by9). -->
  <div class="view360-container is-16by9" id="myPanoViewer">
    <!-- You must add a canvas element inside. -->
    <canvas class="view360-canvas">
  </div>
</body>
```

## Changed options
### image & video
Integrated into Projection's option, [src](../../api/Projection/Interface/ProjectionOptions#src).

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  image: "/path/to/image/image.jpg"
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360, { EquirectProjection } from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  projection: new EquirectProjection({
    src: "/path/to/image/image.jpg", // image & video is integrated into src.
    video: false // For video-related options, use the "video".
  })
});
```

### projectionType
Each projection type is separated into classes for tree-shaking.
You can now use `projection` instead of `projectionType` by importing the projection class.

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  projectionType: "equirectangular"
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360, { EquirectProjection } from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  projection: new EquirectProjection({
    ...some_options // options for the projection
  })
});
```

### projectionType: panorama

- Changed to **CylindricalProjection**
- It won't automatically detect whether it covers all 360 degrees horizontally by the proportion of the user's image.
  - Please use the option **partial**.

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  projectionType: "panorama"
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360, { CylindricalProjection } from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  projection: new CylindricalProjection({
    ...some_options // options for the projection
  })
});
```

### cubemapConfig
- Separated as an option for `CubemapProjection` and `CubestripProjection`.
  - order: Renamed to `cubemapOrder`.
  - tileConfig: Deleted, some features are available with `cubemapFlipX`.

### width & height
Deleted. You can now resize the container elements directly through the CSS.

### yaw & pitch
- Changed to `initialYaw` & `initialPitch` respectively.

### showPolePoint
Deleted.

### useZoom
It can be used in the same way with the option `zoom`

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  useZoom: false
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  zoom: false
});
```

### useKeyboard
It can be used in the same way with the option `rotate.disableKeyboard`.

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  useKeyboard: false
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  rotate: { disableKeyboard: true }
});
```

### gyroMode
- GYRO_MODE.NONE: It can be replaced by `gyro: false`.
- GYRO_MODE.YAWPITCH: It can be replaced by `gyro: true`.
- GYRO_MODE.VR: It can be replaced by `gyro: { ignoreRoll: false }`.

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  gyroMode: "VR"
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  gyro: { ignoreRoll: false }
});
```

### fovRange
We changed it to zoomRange for easier use.
Try [Camera#fovToZoom](../../api/Class/Camera#fovToZoom) to convert the fov value to the zoom value.

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  fovRange: [15, 90]
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  zoomRange: [1, 5] // You can zoom in from 100% to 500%.
});
```

### touchDirection
Deleted and can be replaced with `rotate.disablePitch` and `rotate.disableYaw`.

> v3

```js
import { PanoViewer } from "@egjs/view360";

const panoViewer = new PanoViewer(container, {
  touchDirection: TOUCH_DIRECTION.YAW
});
```

> v4

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360(container, {
  rotate: { disablePitch: true }
});
```

### canvasClass
Deleted. Canvas elements are not automatically created, so you can set class name yourself!

### (static) PanoViewer.isGyroSensorAvailable
- Moved to GyroControl's static metho' `isAvailable`.
- Instead of receiving a callback, it will now return a Promise with availability.

> v3

```js
PanoViewer.isGyroSensorAvailable(available => {
  console.log(available);
});
```

> v4

```js
import { GyroControl } from "@egjs/view360";

const available = await GyroControl.isAvailable();
```

### enableSensor & disableSensor
- Moved to `enable` & `disable` of GyroControl, which can be accessed by `view360.gyro`.

> v3

```js
viewer.enableSensor();
```

> v4

```js
viewer.control.gyro.enable();
```

### enterVR & exitVR
- Moved to `enter & exit` of `view360.vr`.

> v3

```js
viewer.enterVR();
```

> v4

```js
viewer.vr.enter();
```

### getYaw, getPitch, getFov
- Changed to properties of `view360.camera`.

> v3

```js
const currentYaw = viewer.getYaw();
```

> v4

```js
const currentYaw = viewer.camera.yaw;
```

### getYawRange, getPitchRange, getFovRange
- Changed to `view360.camera` method and properties.
- `getFovRange` has been changed to `getZoomRange`.

> v3

```js
const [min, max] = viewer.getYawRange();
```

> v4

```js
// Same to the option "yawRange"
const { min, max } = viewer.camera.yawRange;

// Actual yaw range considering current zoom value
const { min, max } = viewer.camera.getYawRange(viewer.camera.zoom);
```

### getProjectionType
- Deleted.
- Instead, you can access the current projection instance with `viewer.projection`.

### getTouchDirection
- Deleted.

### getImage, getVideo
- It can be replaced by `getTexture()` of View360.

> v3

```js
const image = viewer.getImage();
```

> v4

```js
const image = viewer.getTexture().source;
```

### keepUpdate
- Deleted. View360 now controls whether to render or not.

### lookAt
- It can be replaced with `view360.camera.lookAt` or `view360.camera.animateTo`.

> v3

```js
viewer.lookAt({ yaw, pitch, fov }, duration);
```

> v4

```js
// If you want to change cam direction immediately
viewer.camera.lookAt({
  yaw,
  pitch,
  zoom
});

// When applying animation
viewer.camera.animateTo({
  yaw,
  pitch,
  zoom,
  duration
});

// If you need immediate reflection, you have to call this.
viewer.renderFrame(0);
```

### setImage & setVideo
It can be replaced with `view360.load`.

> v3

```js
panoViewer.setImage("/path/to/image/image.png", {
  projectionType: eg.view360.PanoViewer.PROJECTION_TYPE.CUBEMAP
});
```

> v4

```js
view360.load(new CubemapProjection({
  src: "/path/to/image/image.png"
}));
```

### Other option setters
You can change the value directly only for the options that can be changed.

> v3

```js
panoViewer.setUseKeyboard(false);
```

> v4

```js
view360.rotate.disableKeyboard = true;
```

### updateViewportDimensions
You can change the size of the container yourself.

> v3v

```js
panoViewer.updateViewportDimensions({ width: 250, height: 250 });
```

> v4

```js
const container = viewer.rootEl;

container.style.width = "250px";
container.style.height = "250px";
```

## Events
### error
Deleted. View360Error is now throwed instead.

### animationEnd
Deleted. You can now use `inputStart` and `inputEnd` events instead.
