## Applying Options

View360 accepts options as a second parameter in the form of a JavaScript object.
You can set the option name to key and the option value to the value you want.
For example, if you don't want to use the zoom function and want to turn off zoom, you can set the `zoom` option as follows.

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const viewer = new View360("#el_id", {
  zoom: false
});
```

The same goes for other options! For example, the `yawRange` which receives an object as a value can be set as follows:

```js
import View360 from "@egjs/view360";

const view360 = new View360("#el_id", {
  yawRange: {
    min: -60,
    max: 60
  }
});
```

## Changing Options
Most options are designed to can be changed at any time, except for some that only work at initialization.
If you want to change the option, change the value of `view360.NAME_OF_THE_OPTION`.

```js
// Change the camera fov
view360.fov = 120;
```

However, some options, such as `rotate`, `zoom`, `gyro`, `autoplay`, and `hotspot`, do not store the option values provided by the user.
For example, `view360.rotate` always points to [RotateControl](/docs/api/Class/RotateControl) even if the user set the option `rotate = false`.
In this case, if you want to activate rotate, you can use the following method to enable `RotateControl` instead:
```js
view360.rotate.enable();
```

Changing detailed options is possible the same as changing other options.
```js
// Set the rotate speed as twice as fast.
view360.rotate.pointerScale = [2, 2];
```

Is the option not changeable or doesn't work the way you want it to?
