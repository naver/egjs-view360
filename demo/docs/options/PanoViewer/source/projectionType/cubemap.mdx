Cube mapping is a method of environment mapping that uses the six faces of a cube as the map shape.
The environment is projected onto the sides of a cube and stored as six square textures, or unfolded into six regions of a single texture.
Texture should be given in order of **"RLUDFB(+X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z)"** by default, but you can change it with [cubemapOrder](/docs/options/PanoViewer/source/cubemapOrder)

:::caution

Texture of positive Z(+Z) direction will be shown as front by default.
But as Panoviewer uses [right handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule), camera is looking at negative Z direction internally.
You can change the default direction by using [yaw](/docs/options/PanoViewer/control/yaw) and [pitch](/docs/options/PanoViewer/control/pitch). (both in degrees)
