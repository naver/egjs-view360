Cube mapping is a method of environment mapping that uses the six faces of a cube as the map shape.
The environment is projected onto the sides of a cube and stored as six square textures, or unfolded into six regions of a single texture.

As View360 uses [right handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule), negative Z(-Z) direction will be shown as front by default.
