<OptionDescriptor type="number" defaultVal="1 / 30" added="4.0.0" />

Maximum value of the time difference between frames (in seconds).
It prevents sudden changes in the screen when frame rendering is delayed due to performance, etc.

For example, even if the frame interval is 30 seconds due to delayed rendering, if the option is `0.33`, the internal time will only be updated by `0.33` seconds.
