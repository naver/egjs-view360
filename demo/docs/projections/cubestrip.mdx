```js
import { CubestripProjection } from "@egjs/view360";
```

`CubestripProjection` is almost the same projection as `CubemapProjection`.
The different is, Cubestrip receives only one image. That is, only a single cubemap image in the form 1x6, 2x3, 3x2, and 6x1 is accepted.
Below is an example.

![cubemap](/pano/cube/cubemap.jpg)

Cubestrip's purpose is to use a more efficient rendering method compared to Cubemap when using a single cube map image.
For a single cube map image, `CubemapProjection` internally split it into six images, but `CubestripProjection` does not include that process.

<View360
  projectionOptions={{
    src: "/pano/cube/cubemap.jpg"
  }}
  projectionType="cubestrip"
  showExampleCode />

## Options {#options}
It uses the same option as `CubemapProjection`!

Please check [CubemapProjection's options](./cubemap#options).
