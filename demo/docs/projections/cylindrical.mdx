Like its name, `CylindricalProjection` is a projection that maps images to a cylinder and shows them.
Generally, it is a suitable projection method for displaying panoramic images taken using a smartphone.

Panorama content that can be projected with `CylindricalProjection` usually does not include the entire 360 degree.
This is the case with pitch(up/down) as well as yaw(left/right).

Below is an example of a `CylindricalProjection`. You can view the original image by pressing the image button in the lower right corner of the viewer.

<View360
  projectionOptions={{
    src: "/pano/cylindrical/panorama2.jpg"
  }}
  projectionType="cylindrical"
  showExampleCode />

## Options {#options}
### partial
Cylindrical Projection assumes that the user image covers all 360 degrees in the horizontal direction by default.
If the image you are using does not include all 360 degrees, you can add `partial: true` as below.

<View360
  projectionOptions={{
    src: "/pano/cylindrical/panorama.jpg",
    partial: true
  }}
  projectionType="cylindrical"
  license="snow_mountain"
  showExampleCode />
