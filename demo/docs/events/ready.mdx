import View360, { EVENTS } from "@site/src/components/View360";

```ts
import { EVENTS, ReadyEvent } from "@egjs/view360";

// Typescript
const onReady = (evt: ReadyEvent) => {};

view360.on(EVENTS.READY, onReady);
```

An event that fires when the component is initialized.
This will be called once after [init()](/docs/api/Class/View360#init) is called.

:::info
The example below intentionally disabled all controls for event order checking.

The following is a list of available events in the example:
- "loadStart", "load", "ready", "projectionChange"
:::

<View360
  projectionOptions={{
    src: "/pano/equirect/veste.jpg"
  }}
  license="veste"
  clickToLoad={true}
  rotate={false}
  zoom={false}
  gyro={false}
  showControlBar={false}
  showEvents={Object.values(EVENTS)} />
