# ðŸ”„ Synchronize two viewers

<Sync />

This feature requires additional touch, but can achieved like this.
Suppose there're two instances of View360.

```js
const viewer1 = new View360(...);
const viewer2 = new View360(...);
```

We'll use `viewChange` event, then change the view direction of the other viewer.
But, as changing the view direction of the other viewer will trigger `viewChange` event, we should bypass it like this:
```js
let ignoreViewChange1 = false;
let ignoreViewChange2 = false;

viewer1.on("viewChange", evt => {
  const otherTarget = viewer2;
  if (!otherTarget.initialized) return;
  if (ignoreViewChange1) {
    ignoreViewChange1 = false;
    return;
  }

  ignoreViewChange2 = true;
  otherTarget.camera.animateTo({
    yaw: evt.yaw,
    pitch: evt.pitch,
    zoom: evt.zoom,
    duration: 0
  });
});

// Same for viewer2...
```
